# Milestone Internship Assignment

To compile Java code using the terminal, follow these steps:

1. Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your computer if you haven't already done so.

2. Open a terminal window on your computer.

3. Navigate to the directory where your Java code is located using the `'cd'` command.

4. Type the following command to compile your Java code:

```bash
javac -d . *.java
```

- If the compilation is successful, a new file will be created with the same name as your Java file.

5. To run your program, type the following command:

```java package.filename```

- Again, replace 'filename' with the name of your Java file (without the '.java' extension).

In the assignments examples, it should be

```bash
java exercise2.Main
```

and

```bash
java exercise3.Main
```

That's it ðŸ¥³! Your Java program should now be compiled and running in the terminal.
